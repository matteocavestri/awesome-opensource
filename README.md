## Description

**This project is in WIP state**

**Awesome Open Source Projects** is an initiative to collect and make available fully functional FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) projects, with pre-configured setups to facilitate their deployment and integration in development and production environments. The main focus is on server applications that can be easily deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Curated Projects:** Each included project has been selected for its utility, code quality, and popularity within the open-source community.
- **Ready-to-Use Configurations:** Each project comes with predefined configurations for Docker and Kubernetes, enabling quick and hassle-free deployment.
- **Scalability:** Thanks to Kubernetes integration, projects can easily scale to meet production needs.
- **Detailed Documentation:** Each project includes a step-by-step guide for installation, configuration, and management.
